# isl-notebooks
This repository contains R and Python notebooks code for [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/%7Egareth/ISL/).

It's a learning playground for the book exercises including codes from other repositories (see [Credits](#credits)) in the form of dockerized Jupyter notebooks so it is easier to quickly run and experiment with.

## Notebooks

2. Statistical Learning  
    2.3 Lab - Introduction to [[R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jagin/isl-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/R/2%20Statistical%20Learning/2.3%20Lab%20-%20Introduction%20to%20R.ipynb)][[[Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jagin/isl-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Python/2%20Statistical%20Learning/2.3%20Lab%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb)]  
    2.4 Exercises - [[R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jagin/isl-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/R/2%20Statistical%20Learning/2.4%20Exercises.ipynb)]  
3. Linear Regresion  
    3.6 Lab - Linear Regression [[R](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jagin/isl-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/R/3%20Linear%20Regression/3.6%20Lab%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)][[Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jagin/isl-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Python/3%20Linear%20Regression/3.6%20Lab%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)]  

## Running Jupyter

With [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) you can quickly setup Jupyter environment to run the notebooks and do your own explorations.  
For more details see [opinionated stacks of ready-to-run Jupyter applications in Docker](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks).

To run the isl-notebook container run the following command:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Wait for:

```
...
isl-notebook    |     Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
isl-notebook    |     to login with a token:
isl-notebook    |         http://localhost:8888/?token=your_token
```

to be displayed on your console and follow the instruction.

If you need to run some additional commands in the container run:

```
bash -c clear && docker exec -it isl-notebook sh

```
